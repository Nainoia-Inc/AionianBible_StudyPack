#
# BELIEF:
# 1. In one true God, existing eternally as one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, John 14:9-21, who is in essence spirit, John 4:24, light, 1 John 1:5, and love, 1 John 4:8.
# 2. That the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are the unique, inerrant, inspired Word of God in the original autographs, and the final authority in all matters of faith and conduct, 2 Tim 3:16.
# 3. In the sovereignty and active rule of God in creation, the fall, history, revelation, miracles, prophecy, redemption, and final judgment, Romans 8:20-21.
# 4. That man was created by God in His image, but that since Adam's fall, all men are sinful and by nature deserve God's wrath, Ephesians 2:3.
# 5. That Jesus is the only begotten Son of God, fully human and fully divine, eternally existing as God, yet born in time of a virgin, and that He lived a sinless and perfect life, 2 Timothy 2:5.
# 6. In the historic death of Jesus as the full and only atonement, guaranteeing loving forgiveness for the sins of all mankind, in His bodily resurrection from the dead, and in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, 1 John 2:1-2.
# 7. That all mankind is justified by the loving grace of God and redeemed on the basis of the death of Christ, which is received through faith, Ephesians 2:8-9.
# 8. That the Holy Spirit is the effective agent in regeneration, bringing individuals to faith and transformed lives, 2 Corinthians 3:18.
# 9. In one universal church, Christ’s Body, to which all believers belong, and in local churches accountable to God, lead by officers who govern local church belief and discipline, while respecting individual conscience, Hebrews 13:17, 1 John 2:27.
# 10. That believing mankind is rewarded in paradise after death, while unbelievers suffer punishment in Hades after death merited by their sinful nature and their rejection of the grace of Christ, Luke 16:19-31.
# 11. In the future, visible, physical return of the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, Titus 2:13.
# 12. In the final resurrection of redeemed mankind to the enjoyment of God forever, and the damnation of those excluded from the Book of Life to the Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels for the ages of the ages, Matthew 25:31-46 and Revelation 20:10.
# 13. This statement of Christian faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. The Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality, and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final source of all that we believe.
#
# PRACTICE:
# 1. To glorify God and enjoy him forever, Revelation 21:1-7.
# 2. To defend that true religion is defined by the Christian Scriptures, with God alone as the infallible interpreter of his Word, 2 Timothy 3:14-16 and 1 John 2:20-27.
# 3. To defend that true religion obeys Christ’s commands and imitates his character, John 8:31-23 and 1 John 2:3-6.
# 4. To love and receive all those who trust Jesus as members of the family of Christ and wholly participate in regular Christian fellowship, Romans 10:9 and Hebrews 10:25.
# 5. To honor marriage as ordained by God and to acknowledge God’s only design as the lifetime covenant relationship between one man and one woman, an illustration of Christ and the Church, Genesis 2:19-25 and Ephesians 5:22-33, and that divorce and remarriage is only allowed by Christ in the case of unrepentant marital infidelity and abandonment by an unbeliever, Matthew 19:9 and 1 Corinthians 7:15.
# 6. To order our relationships in the Biblical pattern of respect and submission outlined in Romans 13:1, Hebrews 13:17, and Ephesians 5:21-6:9 with citizens obeying governmental authorities, believers obeying Christian leaders, husbands loving wives, wives submitting to husbands, children obeying parents, fathers not exasperating, but bring children up in the Lord, servants obeying their masters, and masters caring for their servants.
# 7. To be disciples of Christ, trusting and obeying God, loving God and one another, and calling others to do the same, Matthew 22:35-40 and Matthew 28:18-20.
# 8. To know God and to make him known to the unbelieving, 1 Corinthians 15:1-7 and Philemon 6.
# 9. To value, defend, and protect the sanctity of life, mankind being created by God in His image so that human life is of inestimable worth in all its dimensions, including pre-born babies, the aged, the physically or mentally challenged, and every other stage or condition from conception through natural death, Psalm 139:13-16 and Jeremiah 1:4-10.
# 10. To live sober minded lives free from drunkenness, substance abuse, gluttony, or any excess in order to honor our bodies which are the temple of the Holy Spirit and be fit and prepared for serving the Lord, Galatians 5:16-26 and Titus 2:11-14.
# 11. To serve as Christ’s peacemaking agents on earth waging war against Satan’s divisive lies, limiting ourselves to the weapons of God’s word, prayer, and a Christ-like attitude, 2 Corinthians 10:3-5, Ephesians 6:10-20, and 1 Peter 4:1.
# 12. To hold one another accountable that professing Christians have a responsibility to pursue a godly lifestyle and Christ-like life that is to be enforced and disciplined as described in Matthew 18:15-20, 1 Corinthians 5: 1-13, 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15, and 1 Timothy 5:17-21.
# 13. This statement of Christian behavior does not exhaust the extent of our practice. The Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality, and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final authority of all of our behavior.  We also recognize that every matter great or small is within the realm of God’s loving concern, but prioritize our concerns to the greatest matters of Christian conscience first, Romans 11:36 and 2 Corinthians 10:3-5.  For purposes of The Corporation’s practice the Board of Directors is The Corporation’s final interpretive authority on the Bible’s meaning and application.
#
# TRANSLATE:
# 1. Pray, recruit a committee of faithful Christians, and confirm the above basic Statement of Faith.
# 2. Agree that translations are not inspired or infallible, though hopefully faithfully made, because only the original autographs of Scripture are God-breathed and inerrant.
# 3. Translate and do not paraphrase, prioritizing the contexts of phrase, sentence, paragraph, book, author, testament, Bible, and history.
# 4. Allow for cumbersome and ambiguous translation, if needed, until understanding is made more certain.
# 5. Maintain the Holy Spirit's gender choice of words because male and female is wonderful gift from God and a reflection of His image, and Biblical roles for men and women are a cause for celebration, not apology.
# 6. Maintain word and phrase order when possible, allowing some reduced readability, if needed, to maintain the structure of the original.
# 7. Preserve word repetition and continuation (same theme different word) with concordant translation as much as possible to help the reader appreciate the major and minor themes, structure, poetry, and nuance of the original.
# 8. Translate Abyssos, Geenna, Hadēs, Limnē Pyr, Sheol, and Tartaroō as distinct locations.
# 9. Translate aïdios as eternal and aiōn as age or eon.
# 10. Translate aiōnios as an adjective of aiōn, that is pertaining to the age, as life, lifetime, entire, whole, or consummate, but not as eternal or infinite time.
#
# STATEGY:
# 1. Pray for a modern public domain translation in every language.
# 2. Use https://AionianBible.org for study, parallel Bible text viewing, and extended Strong's lexicon entries.
# 3. Download https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data for direct access to the STEPBBible data.
# 4. Use other resources as available and needed.
# 5. Install https://notepad-plus-plus.org or a text editor with REGEX for advanced text search and edits.
# 6. Use the Aionian Bible verse per line format of "3-digit-book-index	3-character-book-abbreviation	3-digit-chapter-number	3-digit-verse-number	verse-text".
# 7. Create a new translation editing the verse line containing "NEW:".
# 8. Use modern spelling and grammar checkers if possible.
# 9. Use correct style and punctuation, as well as smart quotes.
# 10. Add lines beginning with "#" for comments as needed.
# 11. Release your work as CC0 (public domain), CC-BY (attribution), CC-BY-SA (shared with copyright), and avoid CC-ND (no derivative) and CC-NC (no commercial) so Bibles can be further developed and sold.
# 12. Submit your new translation to AionianBible.org and other outlets for distribution.

# FORMAT HEBREW: (Holy-Bible---[language]---AB-StudyPack.txt)
# Columns: Pointed, Accented, Morphology, Extended Strongs
# Indication of Ketiv or Qere reading.
# 	The Qere is the scribal version in the margin.
#	Ketiv is the version found in the main text (if it is unpointed, the pointed version has been produced by Westminster and occasionally corrected by Tyndale scholars).
#	Most translations follow the Qere. 
# Word
#	Pointed form.
#	Accented forms from Westminster Leningrad text WLC 4.20 via OpenScriptures occassionally corrected towards the Leningrad Codex by Tyndale scholars.
# Morphology is from ETCBC in the form defined by OpenScriptures at https://openscriptures.github.io/morphhb/parsing/HebrewMorphologyCodes.html#vt
#	for the source of ETCBC and conversion method by Tyndale House, see https://goo.gl/yKaXQq#HebMorph2
#	ETCBC only parses the Qere. The Ketiv versions have been parsed by Tyndale scholars - see e.g. Deu.33.2-15
# Extended Strongs numbers are augmented (with additions of "a", "b" etc) in line with BDB based on OpenScriptures
#	and extended into the 9000s to include prefixes & suffixes - as in TBESH - Translators Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Hebrew at https://STEPBible\.github.io/STEPBible-Data/
#	§numbers represent submeanings within the Strongs number,  added by Tyndale scholars (not fully checked)
#	§names represent unique names for people, places and other proper nouns such as months etc.
#	as in TIPNR - Translators Individualised Proper Names with all References at https://STEPBible\.github.io/STEPBible-Data/
#
# FORMAT GREEK: (Holy-Bible---[language]---AB-StudyPack.txt)
# Columns: Type, Greek, English, Strongs, Morphology, Lexical, Gloss, Editions, Spellings, Meanings, Spanish, Sub-meaning, Super-meaning, Conjoin word
# Word Types:
#	=NA same TR	133304 words are translated in both traditional KJV and modern Bibles.		NA27/28 + TR + others all having the same meaning				
#	=NA diff TR	3922 words may translate differently in traditional and modern Bibles.		NA27/28 + others having the same meaning but there are.also .. 				| Variants = different meanings in TR + others
#	=NA not TR	761 words are translated in most modern Bibles but not in the KJV.			NA27/28 + others having the same meaning but not TR				
#	=TR+NIV/ESV not NA	227 words are translated in the KJV and in some modern Bibles.		TR + others having the same meaning but not NA27/28				
#	=TR not NA,NIV/ESV	3573 words are translated in the KJV but not in most modern Bibles.	TR + others having the same meaning but not NA27/28				
#	Not in NA or TR	245 words occur in early manuscripts but not translated in most Bibles.	Others having a word that is not found in TR or NA27/28	
#
#	This text is a Bible translator resource from the STEPBible Tyndale Amalgamated Hebrew and Greek.
#	The Greek text is tagged 'NA=TR' (default Nestle/Aland = Textus Receptus) 133,304 words from NA27/28+TR+others with same meaning,
#	'NA~TR' 3,922 words from NA27/28 with different meanings in TR, 'NA-TR' 761 words in NA27/28 not in TR,
#	'KJV' 3,573 words in TR not in NA27/28, 'KJV+' 3,573 words in TR+Older Bibles but not in NA27/28,
#	'KJV++' 227 words in TR+Modern Bibles but not in NA27/28, 'NATR?' 245 words not found in NA27/28 or TR.
#	New Testament study is revolutionized by the discovery of earlier manuscripts in the North African sands and other discoveries.
#	Most modern Bibles rely on these new discoveries. The NA text is based mostly on these earlier manuscripts,
#	but the TR text was put together from later ones, before the earlier ones were found.
#	Apparently later scribes often removed ambiguities with changes like adding the name "Jesus" instead of "he",
#	adding prepositions such as "with" and "to" instead of relying on Greek cases like dative and genitive,
#	and occasionally adding phrases to clarify the text. There are no instances of changed theology confirmed by the huge failed effort to find even one.
#	Less discussed are the words found in the earlier manuscripts, but not in the later.
#	Of these there are 548 differences with no impact to meaning and 277 scribal clarification differences.
#	And these are only mildly significant changes like "72" for "70" disciples sent out in Luke 10:1,17,
#	"Spirit of Jesus" for "Jesus" in Acts 16:7, "as you now walk" in 1Th 4:1, "according to God" in 1Pet 5:2,
#	"show mercy to others" in Jude 23, and "and a third of the earth was burned" in Rev 8:7.
#	The best explanation is that the additions found only in earlier manuscripts and the additions found only
#	in later ones are simply two sets of additions by scribes to clarify the text with no theological agenda.
#	So, if you want the very earliest text, use only the words that are in both NA and TR.
#	If you want to include clarifications by North African believers like modern Bibles, then include words found only in NA.
#	If you want to include the clarifications by Byzantine scribes like the KJV, then include the words found only in TR, and use the TR variants.
