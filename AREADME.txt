# STATEMENT
# 1. In one true God, existing eternally as one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, John 14:9-21, who is in essence spirit, John 4:24, light, 1 John 1:5, and love, 1 John 4:8.
# 2. That the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are the unique, inerrant, inspired Word of God in the original autographs, and the final authority in all matters of faith and conduct, 2 Tim 3:16.
# 3. In the sovereignty and active rule of God in creation, the fall, history, revelation, miracles, prophecy, redemption, and final judgment, Romans 8:20-21.
# 4. That man was created by God in His image, but that since Adam's fall, all men are sinful and by nature deserve God's wrath, Ephesians 2:3.
# 5. That Jesus is the only begotten Son of God, fully human and fully divine, eternally existing as God, yet born in time of a virgin, and that He lived a sinless and perfect life, 2 Timothy 2:5.
# 6. In the historic death of Jesus as the full and only atonement, guaranteeing loving forgiveness for the sins of all mankind, in His bodily resurrection from the dead, and in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, 1 John 2:1-2.
# 7. That all mankind is justified by the loving grace of God and redeemed on the basis of the death of Christ, which is received through faith, Ephesians 2:8-9.
# 8. That the Holy Spirit is the effective agent in regeneration, bringing individuals to faith and transformed lives, 2 Corinthians 3:18.
# 9. In one universal church, Christ’s Body, to which all believers belong, and in local churches accountable to God, lead by officers who govern local church belief and discipline, while respecting individual conscience, Hebrews 13:17, 1 John 2:27.
# 10. That believing mankind is rewarded in paradise after death, while unbelievers suffer punishment in Hades after death merited by their sinful nature and their rejection of the grace of Christ, Luke 16:19-31.
# 11. In the future, visible, physical return of the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, Titus 2:13.
# 12. In the final resurrection of redeemed mankind to the enjoyment of God forever, and the damnation of those excluded from the Book of Life to the Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels for the ages of the ages, Matthew 25:31-46 and Revelation 20:10.
# 13. This statement of Christian faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. The Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality, and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final source of all that we believe. For purposes of The Corporation’s belief the Board of Directors is The Corporation’s final interpretive authority on the Bible’s meaning and application.
#
# TRANSLATING:
# 1. Pray, recruit a committee of faithful Christians, and consider carefully your motives before departing from the above Statement of Faith.
# 2. Acknowledge that translations are not inspired and contain errors, through hopefully they are faithfully made, because only the original autographs of Scripture are God-breathed and without error.
# 3. Translate and do not paraphrase, prioritizing the contexts of phrase, sentence, paragraph, book, author, testament, Bible, and history.
# 4. Allow for cumbersome and ambigous translation when the original meaning is also uncertain.
# 5. Maintain the Holy Spirit's gender choice of words because male and female is wonderful gift from God and a reflection of His image, and Bibical roles for men and women are a cause for celebration, not apology.
# 6. Maintain word and phrase order when possible, allowing some reduced readability if needed to capture the emphasis of the original language.
# 7. Preserve word repetition and continuation (same theme different word) for a concordant translation as much as possible to help the reader appreciate the major and minor themes, structure, poetry, and nuance of the original.
# 8. Translate Abyssos, Geenna, Hadēs, Limnē Pyr, Sheol, and Tartaroō as distinct locations.
# 9. Translate aïdios as eternal and aiōn as age or eon.
# 10. Translate aiōnios as an adjective of aiōn, that is pertaining to the age, life, lifetime, entire, whole, or consummate, but not as eternal or infinite time.
